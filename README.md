### Melody Mars Mission

#### Assumptions
The Melody Mars Mission is to explore the surface of Mars. Initially one vehicle, the Mars Rover, will be sent to the surface. The rover will be controlled from Mission Control, initially from Earth, later from closer (a space station or a ground station).

Due to the distance between Earth and Mars, there will be a signal lag of between 5 and 20 minutes. So initially commands moving the rover will be via batch commands. The rover will have to decide if the received command is safe or possible.

It will be guided by our detailed maps Mars, and (to be implemented) real-time data from an on-board camera.
